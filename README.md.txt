Super simple flight computer program
Note that all of these files must be in the same folder.  That folder should be in the same folder that holds your
other sketch folders.  Name that folder Super_Simple_Board.  It should contain:
  Super_Simple_Board.ino; 
  Menu.h; 
  Menu.ino;  
  Rocket.h; 
  Rocket.ino; 
  Storage_Modules.h; 
  Storage_Modules.ino.
  
When you open the program Super_Simple_Board.ino in your Arduino IDE, the other programs should load along with it automatically.
